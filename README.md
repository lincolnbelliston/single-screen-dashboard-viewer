# single-screen-dashboard-viewer
View several browser windows in one screen with pinnable preview sidebar.

The Decision Theater's primary tool is a seven-monitor display for visualizing complex data sets. This tool was created to provide a way to view the seven "dashboards" on a single screen, providing a sidebar with thumbnail previews of each screen. The website content is password protected, so I replaced the Decision Theater content with generic content. The urls can be edited in index.html.
